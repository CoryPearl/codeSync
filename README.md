This is a collaborative programing website I made for my IB Computer Science IA.

Info:

- All files the server requires accses too such as the email template, sql data and https keys are located in the serverAssets folder
- The public folder contains all info that is sent to the client when they connect, it includes socme librarys such as highlight.js and socketio that I took from github, it also  
  conatins a folder called assets which is simply images used by the website.
- The temp folder is a folder to create temporary instances of python files and java files in to collect their output
